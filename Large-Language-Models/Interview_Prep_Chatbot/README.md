# Interview Prep Chatbot 🤖

An **AI-driven Interview Simulation Chatbot** built to demonstrate practical expertise in **LLM application development, prompt engineering, and automated evaluation systems**.

This project simulates a real-world technical interview by dynamically generating topic-based questions, capturing candidate responses, and evaluating them using structured scoring criteria. It showcases how Large Language Models can be operationalized for **assessment, feedback, and decision-support systems**.

Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, this project reflects industry-relevant skills expected from **AI Engineers, Data Scientists, and Applied ML Engineers**.
